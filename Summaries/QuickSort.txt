Quick Sort does a very good think as In Place sorting
Minimizes data movement

Divide and Conquer for merge Sort and quicksort
Quicksort will do partition instead.

Idea:
[1,7,2,4,6,8,3]

Do a partition by choosing a pivot it can be any element.

Pseudocode:

Quicksort (A, left, right)
   1. Choose a pivot example A[right]
   2. position = partition (A, right)
   3. Quicksort (A, left, position - 1)
   4. Quicksort (A, position + 1, right)

    
Worst Case analysis

ideal goal is a balanced partition. meaning, the partition element is bigger than right side and smaller than left side
Worst scenario is on a already sorted array with partition element being the biggest
